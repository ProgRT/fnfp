	abstract = {Objective: The incidence, pathophysiology, and consequences of patient-ventilator asynchrony are poorly known. We assessed the incidence of patient-ventilator asynchrony during assisted mechanical ventilation and we identiﬁed associated factors. Methods: Sixty-two consecutive patients requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h were included prospectively as soon as they triggered all ventilator breaths: assist-control ventilation (ACV) in 11 and pressure-support ventilation (PSV) in 51. Measurements: Gross asynchrony detected visually on 30-min recordings of ﬂow and airway pressure was quantiﬁed using an asynchrony index. Results: Fifteen patients (24\%) had an asynchrony index greater than 10\% of respiratory efforts. Ineffective triggering and double-triggering were the two main asynchrony patterns. Asynchrony existed during both ACV and PSV, with a median number of episodes per patient of 72 (range 13–215) vs. 16 (4–47) in 30 min, respectively (p = 0.04).},

	url = {https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/Abstract/2000/02000/Autotriggering_caused_by_cardiogenic_oscillation.19.aspx},
	abstract = {Objectives: 
        We noticed that in some patients after cardiac surgery, when flow triggering was used, cardiogenic oscillation might be autotriggering the ventilatory support. In a prospective study, we evaluated the degree of cardiogenic oscillation and the frequency rate of autotriggering. We suspected that autotriggering caused by cardiogenic oscillation was more common than clinically appreciated.
        Design: 
        Prospective, nonrandomized, clinical study.
        Setting: 
        Surgical intensive care unit in a national heart institute.
        Patients: 
        A total of 104 adult patients were enrolled after cardiac surgery.
        Interventions: 
        During the study period, patients were paralyzed and ventilated with intermittent mandatory ventilation at a rate of 10 breaths/min, pressure support of 10 cm H2O, and flow triggering with a sensitivity of 1 L/min.
        Measurements and Main Results: 
        Because the patients would not be able to breathe spontaneously, we counted pressure-support (PS) breaths as instances of autotriggering. Then, we classified the patients into two groups according to the number of PS breaths: an “AT group” (PS breaths of {\textgreater}5/min) and a “non-AT group” (PS breaths of ≤5/min). If autotriggering occurred, we decreased the sensitivity so autotriggering disappeared (threshold triggering sensitivity). The intensity of cardiogenic oscillation was assessed as the flow and airway pressure at the airway opening. A total of 23 patients (22\%) demonstrated more than five autotriggered breaths/min. During mechanical ventilation, the inspiratory flow fluctuation caused by cardiogenic oscillation was significantly greater in the AT group than in the non-AT group (4.67 ± 1.26 L/min vs. 2.03 ± 0.86 L/min;p{\textless} .01). The AT group also showed larger cardiac output, higher ventricular filling pressures, larger heart size, and lower respiratory system resistance than the non-AT group. As the inspiratory flow fluctuation caused by cardiogenic oscillation increased, the level of triggering sensitivity also was increased to avoid autotriggering. In the AT group with 1 L/min of sensitivity, the respiratory rate increased (19.9 ± 2.7 vs. 10 ± 0 breaths/min,p{\textless} .01), PaCO2 decreased (30.8 ± 4.0 torr [4.11 ± 0.36 kPa] vs. 37.6 ± 4.3 torr [5.01 ± 0.57 kPa];p{\textless} .01), and mean esophageal pressure increased (7.7 ± 3.0 vs. 6.9 ± 3.0 cm H2O;p{\textless} .01) compared with the threshold triggering sensitivity.
        Conclusions: 
        Autotriggering caused by cardiogenic oscillation is common in postcardiac surgery patients when flow triggering is used. Autotriggering occurred more often in patients with more dynamic circulation. Autotriggering caused respiratory alkalosis and hyperinflation of the lungs.},

This interaction may lead to patient-ventilator asynchrony, preventing the ventilator from achieving its goals, and may cause patient harm. Flow, volume, and airway pressure signals are significantly affected by patient-ventilator interaction and may serve as a tool to guide the physician to take the appropriate action to improve the synchrony between patient and ventilator. This review discusses the basic waveforms during assisted mechanical ventilation and how their interpretation may influence the management of ventilated patients. The discussion is limited on waveform eye interpretation of the signals without using any intervention which may interrupt the process of mechanical ventilation.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review 
        The coupling between ventilator delivered inspiratory flow and patient's demands both in terms of timing and drive is a challenging task that has become largely feasible in recent years. This review addresses the new advances to modulate and treat patient–ventilator dyssynchrony.
        Recent findings 
        Patient–ventilator dyssynchrony is a common phenomenon with conventional modes of mechanical ventilation which influence the duration of mechanical ventilation. Inspection of pressure, volume and flow waveforms represents a valuable tool for the physician to recognize and take the appropriate action to improve patient–ventilator synchrony. New developments have been introduced aiming to improve patient ventilator synchrony by modulating the triggering function and the variables that control the flow delivery and the cycling off.
        Summary 
        Patient–ventilator dyssynchrony may affect patients' outcome. New modes of assisted mechanical ventilation have been introduced and represent a major step forward in modulating patient–ventilator dyssynchrony.},
